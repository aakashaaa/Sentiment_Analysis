# Sentiment analysis using Google News

### Project Brief

As we know the basic terminology about Sentiment Analysis. In this project we are going to use Google News as a main source to scrap texts and find sentiments from it.

### Advantages / Applications

For example, if a person wants to join a new firm, he might go to Google to read about the company, it's work culture and it's past performance. Going through different web links that person makes up his / her judgement of how the company is performing in news right now.
