# Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. It allows businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online conversations and feedback.

## How does sentiment analysis work?
### The basics
Basic sentiment analysis of text documents follows a straightforward process:

1. Break each text document down into its component parts (sentences, phrases, tokens and parts of speech)
2. Identify each sentiment-bearing phrase and component
3. Assign a sentiment score to each phrase and component (-1 to +1)

As you’ll see, the underlying technology is very complicated. But for a simple explanation of sentiment analysis, consider these sentences:

### Terrible pitching and awful hitting led to another crushing loss.
### Bad pitching and mediocre hitting cost us another close game.

Both sentences discuss a similar subject, the loss of a baseball game. But you, the human reading them, can clearly see that first sentence’s tone is much more negative.

Your brain figures this out by looking for and interpreting sentiment-bearing phrases – that is, words and phrases that carry a tone or opinion. These usually appear as adjective-noun combinations. In the examples above, the sentiment-bearing phrases are:

### Terrible pitching | awful hitting | crushing loss

### Bad pitching | mediocre hitting | close game

You have encountered words like these many thousands of times over your lifetime across a range of contexts. And from these experiences, you’ve learned to understand the strength of each adjective, receiving input and feedback along the way from teachers and peers.
